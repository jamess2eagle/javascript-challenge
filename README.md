## Background

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive web-page where the user can filter the data by filling out the filter search box.  The dataset contains information of UFO sightings and it is broken down by date, city, state, country, shape and comment. The following data that was used is named data.js and can be located in
[here](https://github.com/jamess2eagle/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-2/static/js/data.js)

There will be two versions (UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2) of this web-page and the only difference is that level-1 only provides one field to filter the data by date whereas level-2 has five different fields to filter the data.
Each folder consists of a static folder that consists of css, images and js files.  the filter functionality can be located [here](https://github.com/jamess2eagle/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-2/static/js/app.js)
